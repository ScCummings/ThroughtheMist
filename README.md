# ThroughtheMist
A pixel art game created as part of the HackSC 2020 competition.
Through the Mist follows two brothers as they make their way home. One grappiling with his mental illness and the other
helping him along the way. It is a narrative that perfectly encapsulates the concept that mental illness trully affects us all
and we hope that players will be able to build trust and faith in one another as they continue on in their journey. 

In the spirit of the Hackathon, all assets were created by our two person team this weekend. 

We wished to focus on network capabilities as well as interesting designs and gameplay and so much of the art is left unfinished

Implmentation: 
Unity's Particle Systems were used to create the mist affect and the player playing as the younger brother can remove the mist as it surrounds their older brother. Interestingly enough, the older brother may delete the mist as well, but only if with his younger brother. 

For the second puzzle of the game, we created simple scripts to iterate through various art assets in order to create a fun interactable experience!

For the third puzzle of the game, arguably the most technically difficult. We used Unity's raytracing to track the other brother's movement, and while he was in the line of sight of the bottle of alchohol, he was frozen in fear. However, if the younger brother breaks this line of sight, the older brother is free to move again. Eventually making his way back to where he belongs.
